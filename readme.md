Accounting @ Hussains is made to be a Double Entry Accounting Software written in PHP with the CodeIgniter Framework using MySQL.
The software is a simple software that is very limited, but used more as a presentation to showcase how simple double entry
accounting can be implemented. There are various pieces of code that are not industry quality, but this is again used to merely
showcase certain programming abilities.


### Release Information


This repo contains in-development code for future releases.


### Changelog and New Features


You can find a list of all changes for each push in the `Commits <https://github.com/Polkm7/SoftwareApplicationDomainProject/commits/master>`_.


### Server Requirements


PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended...
MySQL database support.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
